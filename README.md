# TSMC - Typescript Machine Compiler

A (Work-in-progress) typescript compiler that compiles straight to machine-readable binaries, written in Go-lang.

## Roadmap/Future Goals
- Get it actually working (lol)
- Maybe rewrite in a language that can allow for faster more efficient compilation (Rust, C, zig, etc.) (basically any low-level lang except C++)
